FM-GetStartedWithJavascript
===========
FileMaker Pro and FileMaker Pro Advanced is now able to make use of the FMP URL protocol to include support for calling a script to run in FileMaker from within a web viewer.

This is a big deal.

Working with the web viewer is now a two way street. You set the web viewer from FileMaker, and now you get data back from what is going on inside the web viewer.

Previously this capability was only available in FM Go or if you happened to be running FileMaker Pro with a file hosted on FileMaker Server. By removing that constraint, this opens up a lot of possibilities for developers to extend and improve the solutions we build.

In this example file, we demonstrate why being able to comminucate with a web viewer is a big deal, including:

 1. How to call a FileMaker script with Javascript.
 2. How to pass information to your FileMaker Script.
 3. Use popular javascript libraries, such as Jquery, in your FileMaker solutions.
